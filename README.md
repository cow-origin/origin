# Cow Origin

I assure you there isn’t an origin like this one! Introducing the cow origin, the first in the weekly series of cursed origins I’m going to make for fun!
The cow origin is an incredibly unbalanced almost unplayable origin with more bugs then you could find under a rock.

Other features: THE MILK DIMENSION! Craft milk blocks with four milk buckets, place it like a nether portal would. 
Then craft a milk dimension portal opener with one sugar and a milk block above it. Use the opener on the portal like you would flint and steel and boom!

Inside the milk dimension you have nether spawns + overworld spawns, nether + overworld buildings and LOTS OF MILK, you can find the custom mob “Apostle of milk” here too, killing the new mob drops you the new upgraded pickaxe the “Milkaxe” with extreme mining speed and crazy damage

Once you defeat the apostle of milk you unlock your final power: Domain expansion
